# Errors

To perform the SCA analysis, we have generated this code to run different errors in the microcontroller and see how the EM and power signals vary. The executed errors are the following ones:

- Floating point overflow
- Floating point underflow
- Integer overflow
- Integer underflow
- Divide by zero integer
- Divide by zero decimal
- Segmentation fault
- Buffer overflow
- Double free
- Null pointer dereference 
- Out-of-bounds Write
- Out-of-bounds Read
- Out-of-memory
- Stack overflow
- Stack underflow
- Unaligned address
